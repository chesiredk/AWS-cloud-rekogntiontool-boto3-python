# AWS-cloud-rekogntiontool-boto3-python/pysimplegui/cli

I created an Amazon website acc then created a bucket faciallimages from where I inserted images into.
In the GUI file, I had a complete self dependant process that the file connected to the rekognition tool in my aws and uploaded the files, and also completed the function as dictated and returned the response to python for output.
In the CLI, it was more simple and experimental, I had to manually upload images to the aws bucket and change their links manually in the code in order to manipulate the 4 functions: "Detect labels, texts, face comparison and face mood" in the python code.
I made a youtube video where I further explained this projects, The link is: https://youtu.be/V1gg5Ki0pkA
